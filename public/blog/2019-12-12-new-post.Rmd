In addition to R, Python is a valuable tool that can be applied to biology. For example, k-mers are useful in genetics and can be used for a variety of reasons such as sequence assembly, taxonomy, manipulating protein expression, etc. Below is a function that is able to find 3-mers in a sequence and record the frequency number in a dictionary. 
```{python}
# Find all 3-mers in these two sequences
my_seq1 = "ATCATCATG"
my_seq2 = "CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT"

def findThreemers(seq):
    dict1={}
    a = 0 
    b= 3
    three_mer= seq[a:b]
    while len(three_mer)==3: 
        if three_mer in dict1: 
            dict1[three_mer]+= 1
        else: 
            dict1[three_mer]= 1
        a+=1
        b+=1
        three_mer= seq[a:b]
    print (dict1)

def main(): 
    print("In the first sequence, the 3-mers are :")
    findThreemers(my_seq1)
    print (" In the second sequence, the 3-mers are: ")
    findThreemers(my_seq2)
main()
```
