#About Me 
  My name is Cara (Yijin) Zou and I'm currently a junior computational biology major at UT Austin. I'm also a pre-dental student. I'm from Katy, Texas but I've also lived in China, Canada, Malaysia, and Singapore! I love travelling and I've been to over 20 countries including Cambodia, Austrailia, Thailand, Brunei, France, etc. I'm currently involved in research in the Virtual Drug Screening/Virtual Cures stream where I am trying to identify a potential drug for D-alanine D-alanine ligase (*Mycobacterium tuberculosis*) using both computational and wet lab methods (the picture on the home page is a PyMol 3D representation of this enzyme). 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
