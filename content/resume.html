<p>#About Me
My name is Cara (Yijin) Zou and I’m currently a junior computational biology major at UT Austin. I’m also a pre-dental student. I’m from Katy, Texas but I’ve also lived in China, Canada, Malaysia, and Singapore! I’m currently involved in research in the Virtual Drug Screening/Virtual Cures stream where I am trying to identify a potential drug for D-alanine D-alanine ligase (<em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>) using both computational and wet lab methods (fun fact: the picture on the home page is a PyMol 3D representation of this enzyme).</p>
